# Personal Website - erica.clandrew.com

A home for my artwork and projects. 

## Details

This site is constructed with HTML/Sass on the front end, with PHP for logic and a MySQL database handling the image galleries.

Bootstrap is used for responsiveness and styling. Image interactions are via Lightbox.js.

I also created all the insects in the layout.  They are features, not bugs.
