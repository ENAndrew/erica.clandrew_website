                <p>I'm Erica.  I have not yet been nominated for a Hugo, nor been picked up by the Bungie art department, but I did get my varsity letter on my high school academic team and possess several acrylic plaques celebrating my superior customer service skills.</p>
                
                <p>I love sacred geometry, infernal machines, Nordic fishing villages, and things that only look like people.  I cross stitch little historic samplers and angelic sigil throw pillows.</p>
                
                <p>In college I was lucky enough to study physics and psychology.  I enjoyed my required C++ class so entirely that I picked up programming again in 2015.</p>
                
                <p>I'm available for artwork commissions, font-end web development and design projects, and bird watching.</p>
